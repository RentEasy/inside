RentEasy is an open company. The default visibility of our companies information is open, with the blinds only being closed where it's required.

> Trust is the foundation of the economy. The law establishes a minimum baseline of trustworthiness, and the status quo for companies is to operate near this baseline. What if we tried to maximize trust?
