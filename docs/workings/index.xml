      <description>RentEasy is an open company. The default visibility of our companies information is open, with the blinds only being closed where it&amp;rsquo;s required.
 Trust is the foundation of the economy. The law establishes a minimum baseline of trustworthiness, and the status quo for companies is to operate near this baseline. What if we tried to maximize trust?
From: https://www.opencompany.org/about/
 RentEasy&amp;rsquo;s goal is to provide tenants and landlords with amazing tools to help them keep renting.</description>
